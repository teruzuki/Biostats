For Two Sample t tests in R

```{r t-test}
t.test(temp ~ sex,

t.test(temp ~ sex,
       data = bodytemp,
       paired = FALSE,
       var.equal = FALSE,
       conf.level = 0.95)
```

Output
```
data:  temp by sex
t = 2.2854, df = 127.51, p-value = 0.02394
alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 0.03881298 0.53964856
sample estimates:
mean in group female   mean in group male 
            98.39385             98.10462
